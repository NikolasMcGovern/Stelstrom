&lt;div class=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;\
Long ago, Stelstrom was known as the crown of Knoll, the pride of the city-states, the safehaven of the lost, the glory of peoples, etc., etc.. Think of a meaningless moniker and Stelstrom was probably known as it. As a child, teachers told me stories of the feats accomplished by the heroes and princes and geniuses of the city, their eyes wide and gestures emphatic. As I grew older, when steam and smoke and slavery spread across Knoll, they started whispering. Eventually, the stories were silenced.

Mother never spoke of Stelstrom. What would she think of me now?
&lt;/div&gt;\

“God, you’re so dramatic!”

I jump at the sudden interruption.

“Whoa, don’t fall!” Isaac grabs my arm, holding me steady. “Though to be fair, ‘Death by Dragon Fall’ would be an appropriately dramatic entry into your little diary, wouldn’t it?”

I try to glare at him over my shoulder, but I can’t for long. Isaac’s mischievous grin, wild curls flying in the wind, and mismatched uniform (navy overcoat with black trousers) strikes such an incongruent picture with the quintessential dragon-rider of stories, that it’s impossible to even feign frustration.

“Stop reading over my shoulder,” I grouse halfheartedly. I shrug my arm out of his grasp and face forward, pressing my dog-eared journal against the dragon’s back. I finish my entry.

&lt;div class=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;\
I’m almost there.
&lt;/div&gt;\

Closing the notebook, I reach to place it into the case secured to the saddle. It’s awkward- I have to twist almost completely around because both of my legs are slung lady-style over one side of the dragon- but I manage to undo the leather flap and lift the lid, slipping it inside. As I do, my hands brush against a loose sheet of paper.

The letter.

My heart pounds, as it has every time I’ve touched that bloody scrap since the day it arrived.

I can’t help it. I grab it.

“Dragons above, Warren! You aren’t going to read that stupid thing again, are you?” Isaac groans. “I’m bored. Talk to me!”

“It’s a bit difficult to talk at this height, Isaac,” I reply. As gently as I can, I shift forward, letter in hand, and open the envelope.

I ignore the seal still attached. I memorized its design weeks ago. A dragon scale surrounded by steam set in red wax. Holding to it tightly, I stare at the handwriting, just letting the pointed, decisive strokes swirl across my vision. Gulping, I press the letter to the green scales of the dragon, feeling the tense movement of muscles beneath my hands with every wing-flap, and begin to read.

&lt;div class=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;\
To the Honorable Mr. Warren Lawson, Ministry of Law Enforcement, Rivermire

Your talents and efficiencies have become known across the hills of Knoll to my attention, here in the good city of Stelstrom. A man of your proficiencies could be well-set in a position here, protecting the people from crime and mongrels. Despite our (many) differences, peace is, of course, something valued by the citizens of Rivermire and of Stelstrom alike. I request your presence at the Rebirth Ball hosted at mine own manor. There, we can further discuss your future. One guest is permitted you.

I trust you will not disappoint. Be prompt.

Regards,
Lord J. Bloodworth, All Ministries, Stelstrom
&lt;/div&gt;\

If I’m known to Bloodworth, he is certainly known to me. After the dragon-taming and steam revolution within Stelstrom, James Bloodworth quickly rose from being one of the more unobtrusive aristocrats to, essentially, the head of everything within the city. Most of what I know of the man comes from the word around the Ministry of Law Enforcement. His methods are… effective.

I would not be able to sleep at night.

Though, I’ve not been able to do that since the letter arrived.

What could he want?

[[Slip the letter into my case]]

Taking a deep breath, I nod. He’s right. I replace the letter into the case and secure the lid. “What do you want to talk about?”

“Uhhhh…” Isaac says. He shifts behind me, knocking into my back with his bony elbow. I chuckle and shake my head. He’s probably hastily scanning the countryside beneath as if it can give him some conversational tidbits.

I’m glad I ignored the urge to read the letter again. I close my eyes. The wind whips into my face, pleasantly cool and brisk, and a for a second, I pretend I’m one of those knights that Isaac looks so unlike. I know I look nothing like them too, but God, at least my uniform matches. I open my eyes and look down.

Rolling grassy hills, meadows of yellow poppies, farm houses, and grain fields fly beneath us. We pass over a lake and in the sparkling depths I get a view of the carrier dragon. It’s a standard Green Mid, but for someone who grew up in Rivermire, he may as well have been the most magnificent Red Fire. Widespread dragon-riding is a relatively new development. It’s all thanks to Stelstrom.

“Your mom!” Isaac exclaims.

“What?” I ask.

“Let’s talk about your mom! You mentioned her in your diary.”

“Journal,” I correct. “And there’s not much to tell.”

“Warren, we’ve been friends for five years now and—”

“Are we friends? Really?”

“—and, shut up, and I think a good heart-to-heart is more than overdue!”

I sigh. He’s insufferable. “It won’t be much of a heart-to-heart because there’s not much to tell. She grew up in Stelstrom but moved to Rivermire right before having me. She raised me, loved me, and then caught the steamthroat disease and died right before I started at the Ministry.”

Isaac is silent. That came out a bit more snappish than I had intended.

\
I slip the letter into the case. Once we arrive, it might be better to keep the letter away from pickpockets. If the criminals of the city find out I’m, apparently, affiliated with Bloodworth, I doubt I’ll make it to the Rebirth Ball in one piece.

I slip the letter into my pocket. I can’t risk losing this letter when it might be the only key I have to entering Bloodworth’s manor. And if I don’t arrive at the manor I doubt I’ll be able to survive Bloodworth’s wrath in one piece.

“Sorry,” Isaac says. “I just—”

He stops midsentence.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
\
I glance up.

Stelstrom looms before us.

Massive black towers, steam bellowing from the top, dominate the horizon and the hills. Red skies slash across clouds and the dark silhouette of a dragon soars over the city. Beyond the towers, a massive wheel turns methodically and between the spokes I can make out semblances of castle, mansions, block-shaped buildings, spires, and towers, and all things mechanics and magic.

I gulp. The stories my teachers told always described Stelstrom as a beautiful home, made of cool stone and green vines and enchanting woods. This looks evil.

The dragon begins to curve downward, honing to some unknown beacon. I’m still not sure how dragon-carrying works, but I can’t really think about that right now.

Isaac lets out a whoop. “First dragon landing! Put your hands in the air, it’s more fun!”

I’m not exactly in the mood.

We fly over the walls. The dragon enters a cloud of steam. I can’t see anything but gray and water until the sky and sun slashes my vision suddenly and we are landing at a balcony-like protrusion from one of the massive towers. We enter what is like a stable with stalls and feed, but the stalls are ten feet high each and the feed is a massive pile of animal carcasses.

The dragon lets out a throaty roar.

“Steady there, Frellan!” A woman shouts. “Don’t be a useless whiner!”

I freeze. Useless whiner? There’s only one person I know who—

“What the hell? Warren?”

A young woman stares up at me, holding the dragon’s bridle. She wears a paperboy cap over dirty blonde hair, patched trousers, and a raggedy vest over a shirt that was probably white at some point.

Vinnie Smith.

[[Talk to Vinnie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Talk to Vinnie" tags="" position="407,799" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $letterPosition is &quot;Pocket&quot;&gt;&gt;\
She grins and strides forward. “Warren Lawson! Never thought I’d see you again!” She grabs my arm and jerks me to the ground. I stumble and stagger, trying to regain my balance.

“Vinnie,” I reply. I smile and try to straighten my uniform. “It has been awhile. How are you?”

She pulls a disgusted face. “Ew. So formal.” She turns and offers a hand to help Isaac down. 

“Who’s this?”

“Isaac Summers, miss,” Isaac replies, grinning. He takes her hand and dismounts the dragon. He gestures between us. “You two know each other?”

Vinnie laughs. “Do we! We used to do everything together! Our mothers were maids in the same manor.”

“And then you left,” I say. I try to make it sound joking, but it comes out a bit wrong.

Vinnie’s smile fades. She nods slightly. “Aye. And then I left.”

There’s an awkward silence. Isaac casts me a terrified look. He hates awkward silences.

“Well!” Vinnie claps her hands together. I jump. She grins widely and circles the dragon. She unlatches the case from the saddle and lifts the lid. “Got any food? I’m starved.”

I hurry towards her. “Don’t…!”

She pulls out my journal. She stares at it for a long moment, and her smile becomes a little less 
forced and a lot more… sad? Confused? Social navigation has never been my strong suit.

“You haven’t changed a bit, have you?” She says. “Still writing those little diaries.”

“Ha! See, it is a diary!” Isaac exclaims. He crosses his arms triumphantly. “I told him it was a diary.”

Vinnie glances at Isaac, then back to the dia—journal, dammit. She doesn’t open it. Just stares at it.

She opens it to the last page, tears out the blank piece of paper, grabs my pen from the case and scribbles something down on it.

“Look, I don’t know what you’re doing here, but meet me at this address tomorrow. We need to talk.” She presses the note into my hand, closes the journal, and replaces it in the case. She nods to Isaac. “Nice to meet you.”

With that, she grabs the dragon’s bridle and strides deeper into the tower. Over her shoulder, she shouts instructions. “Door’s behind you. Exit the tower and speak to the gentleman at the bottom of the stairs. He’ll get you where you need to be.”

As Vinnie disappears into the tower, Isaac moves to stand next to me, watching her go.

“What was that all about?” He asks.

“I don’t exactly know,” I reply.

“Huh,” He says. “I didn’t know your mom was a maid.”

“What’d you think she was, a fairy?” I grab the case and tuck it under my arm. I walk to the door. “Let’s go. We’ve got a ball to attend.”

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
She grins and strides forward. “Warren Lawson! Never thought I’d see you again!” She grabs my arm and jerks me to the ground. I stumble and stagger, trying to regain my balance.

“Vinnie,” I reply. I smile and try to straighten my uniform. “It has been awhile. How are you?”

She pulls a disgusted face. “Ew. So formal.” She turns and offers a hand to help Isaac down. 

“Who’s this?”

“Isaac Summers, miss,” Isaac replies, grinning. He takes her hand and dismounts the dragon. He gestures between us. “You two know each other?”

Vinnie laughs. “Do we! We used to do everything together! Our mothers were maids in the same manor.”

“And then you left,” I say. I try to make it sound joking, but it comes out a bit wrong.

Vinnie’s smile fades. She nods slightly. “Aye. And then I left.”

There’s an awkward silence. Isaac casts me a terrified look. He hates awkward silences.

“Well!” Vinnie claps her hands together. I jump. She grins widely and circles the dragon. She unlatches the case from the saddle and lifts the lid. “Got any food? I’m starved.”

I hurry towards her. “Don’t…!”

“Bloodworth,” She whispers. She holds the letter in hand, staring at the seal. Her hand shakes a bit. She looks up at me, wide-eyed. “You know Bloodworth?”

“No,” I reply. “He sent for me.”

“Are you in trouble?” She asks. She drops the letter back into the case, as if it were an ugly rat.

“I…” What can I possibly say to that? I don’t even know.

“Of course not!” Isaac says. “We’ve done nothing to get us in trouble! We’re fine, no need to worry.”

Vinnie still stares at me, concerned.

She suddenly strides forward, grabs my hand, and shakes it. “Good to see you again, Warren.” 

Something papery presses into my palm. Vinnie raises an eyebrow at me, then turns and nods to Isaac. “Good day, sir.”

Taking the dragon’s bridle, she turns and walks off deeper into the tower.

“What was that all about?” Isaac asks.

“I don’t know.”

“Huh,” Isaac says. “Strange girl.” He grabs the case and starts towards a door in the wall behind us.

When he’s far enough away, I glance at the paper she pressed in my hand.

&lt;div class=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;\

[[Head to Hotel|Hotel Entrance]]
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Hotel Entrance" tags="" position="406,951" size="100,100">One of Bloodworth’s carriages, a sleekly elegant vehicle with spires decorating the top rim lead by two glossy black horses, awaits us at the foot of the tower. A pompous-looking servant ushers us inside and slams the door. The windows are curtained and I’m too nervous about getting food stains or oil stains or any kind of stains on them that I don’t move them to observe the view, even though, logically, I know my hands are clean. I’m nervous. I was nervous before, but running into Vinnie did not help. She reminds me of everything I ought to be nervous about.

After a short trip, we arrive at a fancy hotel where the pompous servant ushers us into the lobby and the lobbyist then ushers us into a room and the room service-woman ushers us into the dining area and sets finger sandwiches, mini cakes, and light punch before us. Isaac asked for something a bit more, but she said we would spoil our appetites for the ball.

“We can’t arrive on time,” Isaac says, licking his fingers after the fifth cake. “We’ve got to be probably an hour late. That’s what fancy people do.”

“We’re not fancy people,” I reply.

“We are right now! Look at this place!” Isaac gestures wildly around him. “We’re fancy.”

I try to smile at his antics, but honestly, I can’t. I’m far, far too nervous. I need to calm down before this ball. Being frightened won’t help anything. A walk might do me good.

“I’m going out. I’ll be back in time for the ball though.” I grab my coat and pull it on. “Ball starts at 9 and we will be getting there at 9.”

“It really should be ten,” Isaac grumbles.

“Nine,” I say decisively. I grab a sandwich, stuff it in my mouth, and then head for the door.

Stelstrom’s layout begins by making sense, a logical grid system separated into districts each having a different purpose such as markets, government buildings, or manors, but then, as wealth decreases and population increases, the grid system breaks down and then disappears. Coalcoast Lane, the street indicated on Vinnie’s mysterious letter, is a street lined with hawkers selling garbage food, beggars who are too tired to beg, and muck six inches deep with a ragtag bunch of children wading through it, searching for treasures washing down from the logical grid into their land of chaotic squalor. The sky is invisible, in part due to smog and in part to the precarious stack upon stack tenement buildings.

I cover my nose with my handkerchief and attempt to curb my disgust. Rivermire had its poorer areas, to be sure, but nothing to this extent.

People stare at me as I pass. I am by no means well-dressed, but I am clothed in clean clothes, and that is more than I can say for any of these people.

I stop and close my eyes, just trying to breathe. What am I doing here? I’m only in this godforsaken city because Bloodworth, the most powerful man in all of Knoll, ordered me to come to his mockery of an ancient holiday celebration. Attending a rebellion meeting is neither my prerogative nor is it intelligent in any way.

Yet I’m here.

I wander the streets, gaining more and more strange looks as I pass. Street urchins keep brushing next to me, obviously trying to pickpocket me. Fortunately, I had the foresight to come with empty pockets. The more looks I receive, the more I realize how completely conspicuous I am. 

With Bloodworth’s involvement in my life, that can’t be a good thing.

I spot an old woman huddled beneath makeshift hovel, a little space made from discarded wood and cloth. She gazes at the crowd with mild but intelligent eyes. If I’m going to talk to anyone, she seems like a good start.

“Excuse me, ma’am,” I say gently.

She raises an eyebrow at me. “Aye?”

“Do you know of a woman named Vinnie Smith?” I say. “She’s average height, blondish hair, wears boy’s clothes a lot.”

The old woman eyes my uniform. “I might. What do you want with her?”

“She told me to come here.”

The old woman smirks. “She did, did she? Down the street a few buildings and take a right.”

“Thank you,” I reply, though I’m not sure if my thanks is premature. She could just be trying to get rid of me. I don’t really blame her for the sentiment though. I press a coin into her hand and follow her instructions, walking past the next few tenement buildings and then taking a right down the first alley I discover.

Vinnie Smith stands there, tapping her foot. She grins widely when she sees me. “It’s about time!” She grabs my arm and pulls me into the alley. “Come on! We have to hurry!”

[[Stop and demands information]]
[[Go along with Vinnie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Stop and demands information" tags="" position="435,1401" size="100,100">Skid to a halt. “I’m not going with you until I get some answers. What is this?”

Vinnie pauses. She laughs softly to herself. “Sometimes, I forget what the years can do to a person.”

She walks over to an upturned crate and sits on it. She pats the space next to her and I take it, surprised. I’ve never seen her look so contemplative.

“Warren, do you remember when we were kids? When we played cops and robbers among the laundry our poor mothers kept trying to hang in the garden? You were always the cop and I was always the robber. That’s how we liked it.”

I shake my head, trying to stifle a smile. I did remember, though not exactly like that. “No, Vinnie. That’s how you liked it. You always wanted to be the robber so I had to be the cop.”

She grins. “So I manipulated the truth in my mind a bit. My version’s better. It seems more equal.”

I roll my eyes. “I know from experience there’s no point in arguing with your delusions. But what does this have to do with the fact that you and I are currently sitting in a disgusting alley because you gave me a cryptic note and I’m just stupid enough to go along with it?”

“You’re not stupid!” Vinnie says. She’s suddenly intense, staring directly into my eyes. She grabs my hand. “You’re not stupid. You’re good, Warren. I know you’re good.”

“We haven’t seen each other in years.”

“But I know!” Vinnie continues to stare. I look away, dropping my gaze to the ground. There’s a translucent white slug crawling through the dirt, looking eerily beautiful while simultaneously hideous. I watch its slow progress.

“Look at this place. Look at this ‘disgusting alley’, as you put it. Stelstrom was never like this. It was never supposed to be like this. Everything has been corrupted by greed and want and excess. 
I left Rivermire because I wanted to live life like my father, striving to be better than I had been born. Mother never cared much. She was too complacent. She was content to be a maid working for some nobody in some nobody city-state. Not Father. And not me.” Vinnie nudges the slug with her foot. It moves a bit faster. “I thought that perhaps change was possible within the regime. But I see now it is not. We must purge everything, rid ourselves of everyone within that disgusting government and start anew.”

“You’re not stupid either, Vinnie,” I say quietly. “Mass execution will only lead to anarchy and that will only lead to death.”

“Normally, I’d agree.” Vinnie nods. “But not after I met Mynatt.”

“Who is that?” I ask.

Vinnie stands and offers me her hand. “Come and see!”

[[Go along with Vinnie]]
[[An uneasy feeling grows in the pit of my stomach. This has the makings of a classic rebellion doomed to tragic failure. Angry, starving poor. An idolized leader. A lack of faith in the government.

We zigzag through the alley until we reach a building that looked even more decrepit than the surrounding decrepit buildings. Vinnie knocks on the door- three times, pause, soft twice, three more times- and the door swings opens. It’s pitch dark in there. Vinnie takes me hand again and pulls me inside.

“Stairs, careful” She says.

She leads me down stairs. The darkness gets darker.

She knocks again, the same pattern as before. Another door swings open and light floods my vision, causing me to slam my eyes shut against the sudden stinging.

Once my eyes adjust, I can see that we stand in a simple, small room. There are a few chairs set up in a circle but nobody else is here.

“Commander Mynatt,” Vinnie says, snapping to a salute.

“Ms. Smith,” A cool voice says. A door, hidden in the wall, opens on the far side of the room. A tall, willowy middle-aged woman, wearing a dress that strangely looks militaristic with it’s smart metal buttons, sturdy material, and gold cuff and collar designs, steps into the room.

She pauses at the sight of me. “And a guest. Apparently.”

“This is my friend, Warren Lawson,” Vinnie says. “He is visiting from Rivermire.”

Mynatt smirks. “Visiting. Hardly.”

She prowls forward and offers me her hand. I take it and we shake, but she squeezes hard, threateningly. “Mary Eleanor Mynatt.”

“Warren Lawson,” I reply.

“What are you really doing in Stelstrom, Warren Lawson?”

“Visiting,” I reply.
She chuckles darkly. “Ah, Stelstrom. The vacation spot of the world, known for its hospitality and healthy atmosphere. Don’t insult me, child, you are not visiting.”

“He’s being attacked by James Bloodworth,” Vinnie says.

“Bloodworth?” Mynatt eyes me with more interest. “Bloodworth is after you?”

“I don’t know,” I reply.

“Hmm…” Mynatt says. She leans closer, as if trying to get a better look into my soul. “I doubt you know much. But tell me this, do you believe all people are created equal?”

[[&quot;Absolutely, I want to help.&quot;|Aid Rebellion]]

“Excellent,” Mynatt says. She waves me away dismissively. “You can take him away for now, Vinnie. We’ll be in contact. Get him where he needs to be and then return quickly for the meeting.”

“He can’t stay for the meeting?” Vinnie sounds disappointed.

“No,” Mynatt says. “Not until he has proven himself trustworthy.” She waves again. “Run along.”

And with that, I am shooed out of Mynatt’s presence, out of the strange house, out of the alley, and out of Coalcoast Lane.

I return to the hotel, confused and overwhelmed, but determined to survive the ball without being bombarded with thoughts of my bizarre day.

[[Head to Bloodworth Manor|Ball]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Ball" tags="" position="502,1810" size="100,100">According to a textbook I perused back in Rivermire soon after receiving the letter, the Rebirth Ball was an annual holiday hosted by the King or Queen of Stelstrom hundreds of years ago. The King or Queen, terms that I found to be misleading because upon further study they were essentially judicial farmers, would harvest their own crops and prepare a massive feast for all of Stelstrom. Named Rebirth in order to commemorate the rebirth of Stelstrom’s attention to fulfilment for all, it was one of the most popular celebrations of the year.

However, it was disbanded after the monarchy shifted from being judicial farmers to being simply judicial and then to being, well, monarchs. It was all but forgotten when the monarchy itself was disbanded in favor of aristocratic oligarchy.

Until Bloodworth brought it back.

His Rebirth Ball is nothing like the cutesy pictures shoved into the corners of the textbook. Instead of outside in daylight, it’s at night in his obsidian-formed fortress of a home. Instead of peasants wearing colorful patchwork, magnificent Lords, Ladies, Dukes, Duchesses, Barons, etc. etc. all dressed in monochrome waltz slowly and methodically throughout the ballroom. And instead of cheers and liveliness and food, there is subtle gossip, sly grins, and titters hidden behind lacy fans and gloved hands.

The latter, I assume, is directed at the attire worn by Isaac and I. Though I managed to convince him to actually match his trousers to his uniform, dark blue stands out as starkly abnormal in a fashion ocean of black and ash and gray and coal.

Isaac seems to have noticed and he has lost some of enthusiasm. “You should have told me to change my coat!” He whispers harshly.

I ignore him. There are more important things to worry about. “We need to find Lord Bloodworth and talk to him, That’s why we’re here. Then we can leave. Hopefully.”

Isaac nods. “Fine. Find Bloodworth, get out.”

“You would leave so soon, my good fellows?” A pleasant chuckle sounds behind us. “I suppose that is not surprising, given the tone of my last correspondence with you.”

Isaac and I turn around slowly and we are faced with a dignified but pleasant man in his forties, dressed in a simple white suit, and with features just handsome enough to be commanding but not to the point of discomfort.

He nods his head in deference. “James Bloodworth, at your service.” He offers his hand to me. 

“Mr. Warren Lawson, I assume?”

Numbly, I take his hand and shake it. “Yes, sir.”

Bloodworth nods and smiles. He offers his hand to Isaac.

“Isaac Summers, sir!” Isaac announces. He takes his hand and shakes it vigorously. “And we weren’t planning on staying gone! We were going to find more respectable clothes and then come back!”

“I’m certain of it,” Bloodworth says. He glances at me, smirking. “Mr. Lawson looks like he’s having the time of his life.”

“I am, sir,” I reply.

“There’s no need to lie.”

“I’m not lying. I am here, at this time, in my life. I am having the time of my life.”

Bloodworth thinks for a moment, then laughs heartily. “Witty, are you? That’s good. That’s very good.” He pauses for a moment. “That can be useful.”

I force myself not to fidget nervously. “Are you referring to the content of your letter, sir?”

He nods. “Yes. First, I want to apologize for the tone of it. I had my secretary write it and, generally, I enforce such a tone with the officials of the various city-states. I have found it to be most efficient, though unorthodox. However, I had no intention of treating Rivermire officials as such. Rivermire has been nothing but amenable to the goals of Stelstrom. My secretary did not confirm the style of writing with me and she suffered the consequences, I assure you.”

“She’s alright though, right?” Isaac asks. His face turns red and he shrugs. “Uhh, I mean, we weren’t too bothered by the letter so I hope she didn’t get in too much trouble.”

Bloodworth raises an eyebrow. “She has been well taken care of, I assure you.” He turns back to me. “The tone notwithstanding, the content is accurate enough. I could use your expertise for my most recent endeavor. Help me, and we can make a new Stelstrom, one better for everyone.” He looks away, watching the rest of the ballroom. “A new Stelstrom. One where I don’t have to pander to these imbeciles while good, honest, hardworking people starve and struggle in the streets. A new Stelstrom, where everyone can be happy and willing to obey, no need unmet. A new Stelstrom. It sounds impossible.”

He turns back to me and smiles.“But I have found nothing to be impossible, thus far.”

“What do you want from me, sir?”

“As you may have noticed, there is a bit of unrest within Stelstrom.” Bloodworth smiles ruefully. “More than a bit, actually.”
 
“I didn’t notice anything,” Isaac says. Bloodworth looks at him. Isaac continues, “I mean, I’ve heard about Stelstrom’s crime rates, of course, but they don’t seem abnormal for a city this size. Not to correct you or anything, sir, sorry, I’m just saying—”
 
“There’s no need to apologize.” Bloodworth says. “Yes. The public reports do adequately reflect the norms for a city of our population size.”
 
“Oh! So there’s no problem!”
 
Sometimes, Isaac’s naivete astounds me. He’s lying. Bloodworth is lying to all of Knoll by posting inaccurate crime reports. This is in direct violation of a number of treaties between the city-states, is ethically irresponsible, and has real-world consequences. Vinnie’s mother only let her move to Stelstrom because she believed it was safe. If the reports had been accurate, maybe Vinnie would have never left. Or, alternatively, if Vinnie had been less resourceful, she might have found herself in over her head upon arriving. She could have died.
 
I look up to find Bloodworth observing me, calculating and intense.
 
“The majority of our less-reported crimes are committed by a terrorist gang. The general populace calls them a ‘rebellion’, but I think the term is too generous. Rebellions are attempting to rid the world of the power above them. This group is only seeking to gain the power themselves. They stir up anger, provoke outrage, form riots, rob banks, destroy factories, all of which puts hundreds of good people out of work. They need to be stopped, and quickly, before more people come to harm.”


He thinks for a moment and his smile fades. “I want you to help me destroy the rebellion. I am going to host a city-wide attack on them in exactly a week’s time. I have been gathering the law enforcement officials from all of Stelstrom’s allies and together, I think we can end it. Once the rebellion is gone and no longer feeding lies to the naïve poor, we can begin telling them the truth. We can begin clearing the aristocracy of corruption, with the help of the poor. What say you?”

“I’m sorry, Vinnie.”

“Warren?”

I shrug apologetically. “I can’t take part in this, Vinnie. I’m sorry. I see where you’re coming from, but it’s not the right way.”

Vinnie is silent for a moment. The she smiles softly. “You’re a good person, Warren. Just… whatever you do, try and stay that way.”

I nod. “Thanks for understanding.”

“Yeah, yeah, can’t say I’m too surprised, honestly.” Vinnie points to the alley entrance. “You should go now. If Mynatt finds out I brought you here, there will be hell to pay.”

“Take care of yourself, Vinnie.”

She smiles a bit sadly. “I always do.”

I leave.

[[Go to Bloodworth Manor|Ball]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Question Rebellion" tags="" position="759,1711" size="100,100">“I’m asking for your worldview, child,” Mynatt says impatiently.

“My worldviews?” I repeat.

“You do have them, don’t you?” Mynatt says.

I fight to keep my expression neutral. “Of course I do. I think situations like this are more complicated than a rebellious revolution can accomplish. I think it has the chance of doing more harm than good to the very people you may be trying to help.”

Mynatt nods. “It is a complicated situation. I am a complicated person. I can handle it. Now, do you have any intention of helping this rebellion, or do you stand against us?”

[[“I want to help.”|Aid Rebellion]]

The words have hardly left my mouth before a revolver is pointed at my face.

“No!” Vinnie exclaims. She shoves me backwards and stands in front of me, arms outspread. 

“Don’t! Don’t hurt him!”

“And why shouldn’t I?” Mynatt growls. “He’s a traitor to mankind.”

“No. He’s my friend,” Vinnie says. “Please. He won’t betray me. He won’t. Just let me take him away and you will never see him again, I promise.”

Mynatt considers for a moment. Then she slowly lowers her gun. “Very well. Take him away.”


And with that, I am grabbed and dragged out of Mynatt’s presence, out of the strange house, out of the alley, and out of Coalcoast Lane. Vinnie offers rapid-fire apologies, but I’m not really listening. Everything is too overwhelming. What have I gotten myself into?

I return to the hotel, confused and overwhelmed, but determined to survive the ball without being bombarded with thoughts of my bizarre day.

“You can take him away for now, Vinnie.” Mynatt waves dismissively. “We’ll be in contact. Get him where he needs to be and then return quickly for the meeting.”

“He can’t stay for the meeting?” Vinnie sounds disappointed.

“No,” Mynatt says. “He is not trustworthy. He’s nobody.” She waves again. “Run along.”

And with that, I am shooed out of Mynatt’s presence, out of the strange house, out of the alley, and out of Coalcoast Lane.

I return to the hotel, confused and overwhelmed, but determined to survive the ball without being bombarded with thoughts of my bizarre day.

[[Head to Bloodworth Manor|Ball]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="On Time" tags="" position="168,1558" size="100,100">We arrive at Bloodworth Manor at exactly the moment the gates swing open and the line of waiting carriages parade into what I assume is a courtyard, but a courtyard unlike any I had ever seen. It’s formed entirely of polished black marble, like obsidian made of glass, and it reflects the white-shining lanterns and steam emanating from the overarcing balconies, giving the impression that visitors must walk upon the night in order to enter the manor. The manor wraps completely around the courtyard save for the aforementioned gate. It looks more like a fortress than a home.

I respect the ingenuity of the creators, but I don’t have to appreciate their ingenuity. The place is uncanny. I don’t like uncanny, buildings ought to be… canny.

“I love this place!” Isaac exclaims between deep, heaving breaths. “Why the hell did you insist on walking though? We could have taken a carriage!”

“Walking is healthy,” I reply.

Isaac waves aside my comment. “Stop being pretentious. You’ve got the letter?”

I pat my breast pocket. “Yes.”

“Well, what are we waiting for! Let’s go!”

Taking a deep breath, I nod. We skirt along the edge of the carriage line, show the gatekeeper the letter, the continue into Bloodworth Manor.

[[Enter the ball|Ball]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Aid Bloodworth" tags="" position="354,2036" size="100,100">“Excellent!” Bloodworth replies. “I’ll contact you tomorrow with your first assignment. As of now, eat, drink, enjoy the party.” He nods respectfully. “A pleasure to make your acquaintances, gentlemen.”

“The pleasure is ours!” Isaac answers. As Bloodworth walks away, Isaac turns to me and grins. “So we get to stay at the fancy hotel, right?”

&lt;&lt;if $liedBloodworth is true&gt;&gt;\
“I assume so,” I say. I force myself to smile, but it’s difficult.

None of this can possibly end well.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
“I assume so,” I say. I smile grimly. This won’t be easy, but I think it just might end well.

The rebellion is desperate for knowledgeable leaders. They would foam like a rabid dog at the chance to bring someone like you into their ranks.”

&lt;&lt;if $rebel &lt; 5&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
[[I can’t be a part of this. Every word out of Bloodworth’s mouth has the feeling of a lie. I suppose the best way to converse with him is to lie as well. “Yes. Yes, I’ll help you.”|Aid Bloodworth][$liedBloodworth to true, $rebel += 2]]

&lt;&lt;set $disobeyBloodworth += 1&gt;&gt;\
Bloodworth chuckles darkly. “Everyone belongs in this conflict, boy.”

I can’t pinpoint what it is, but something about his face changes. He goes from looking politely charismatic to something sinister, something bloodthirsty.

It’s gone in a moment. He smiles and nods. “That choice is in your prerogative, of course. 
However, I will point out that without my finances you can no longer remain at the hotel I have you set up in and you also cannot leave Stelstrom until this conflict is resolved. I had intended to pay you well, but I suppose money has little meaning to one born of your means, Warren.”

I’m mildly insulted by his insinuations, but I’m more concerned with the monetary predicament this places us in. Together, Isaac and I might have enough to afford some rooms in a cheaper hotel, but it would not last long. We did not bring much to Stelstrom out of concern for pickpockets. Also, after what I have learned tonight, I’m afraid two middle-class citizens staying in one of the seedier parts of Stelstrom would attract to much attention. We would be in danger.

I have to change tactics.

[[I lie. “Yes. Yes, I’ll help you.”|Aid Bloodworth][$liedBloodworth to true, $rebel += 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Hotel" tags="" position="486,2173" size="100,100">I pace the length of the hotel rooms repeatedly. I imagine I’m annoying the visitors in the rooms below, but I can’t bring myself to muster the energy to care or to stop myself. My life feels so fragile right now, capable of falling and shattering at any moment.

“Good morning!” Isaac says, stumbling out of his room. His hair sticks out in all directions and he is wearing bright purple silk pajamas that I am fairly confident he did not own before. I consider asking, but again, I just don’t care.

“Is breakfast here yet?” Isaac asks.

I point to the table. One of the serving ladies brought up a feast of eggs, toast, oatmeal, pastries, and fruit. Isaac lets out a whoop and rushes to the table. He heaps a plate full of the stuff and starts eating.

“Did you already eat?” He asks.

“No.”

“You’ve got to eat, Warren! We’ve got a big day ahead of us.”

I don’t feel like eating, but I do finally manage to stop pacing and to slump in the chair across from Isaac. “I’m worried,” I say.

&lt;&lt;if $liedBloodworth&gt;&gt;\
“About being rather touchy around Bloodworth last night? I wouldn’t worry about it too much,” Isaac says between bites of pastry. “He’s probably used to it.”

“I acted odd?” I ask.

Isaac shrugs. “You acted nervous.”

That’s disconcerting. What if Bloodworth caught on? What if he knows I have no intention of helping him wipe out the rebellion?

I wipe my sweaty palms on my trousers. I stand suddenly and head for my room.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m going to write,” I say tersely.

Isaac chuckles. “You and that diary. Why don’t—”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
Isaac nods. “I don’t blame you. Bloodworth is intimidating, but you’re brilliant at law enforcement. Back in Rivermire, everyone said you were the best they’d seen in years. You’ll be fine.”

“I wouldn’t say I was the best, but I was good because I knew how to talk to people. I knew how to create and implement laws everyone, at least on some level, could agree with. This? Stelstrom? I don’t know.”

“Look,” Isaac leans forward, expression earnest. “Yes, things will be different here. But you weren’t good in Rivermire because you were or a good listener or wrote in a diary because you are sensitive or because you could find compromises. You were good because you were irrevocably loyal to the people you served. You’re serving Bloodworth now, so you just need to be loyal and everything will work out. I know it.”

I don’t have his confidence, but his miniature speech did help a bit. I stand and cross the room.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m going to write.”

Isaac laughs. “Did you not hear a word I just said?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Before I can find either a proper retort or my journal, a knock sounds on the door.

I exchange a glance with Isaac before walking to the door.

[[Open Door|Bloodworth at door]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Meet Vinnie" tags="" position="194,2120" size="100,100">The next day, I slip out of the hotel room early in the morning and follow the address Vinnie gave me. It was only yesterday when last we spoke, but it seems like it’s been longer. Perhaps that has something to do with the years we have spent apart.

The address leads me to a tenement house located in the slums. The streets are lined with hawkers selling garbage, beggars who are too tired to beg, and muck six inches deep with a ragtag bunch of children wading through it, searching for treasures washing down from the glittering aristocracy into their land of chaotic squalor. The sky is invisible, in part due to smog and in part to the precarious stack upon stack tenement buildings.

I cover my nose with my handkerchief and attempt to curb my disgust. Rivermire had its poorer areas, to be sure, but nothing to this extent. I hurry into the indicated building.

The stench is worse here, adding body odor to the mix of refuse and smoke. And it’s crowded. A line of sooty laborers, mostly women and children, push and shove through this room to get into a smaller room, likely the lavatory. They give me hurried, fearful looks.

“Warren!” Vinnie shouts through the crowd.

“Vinnie,” I say in relief. She’s standing on some hitherto unnoticed stairs in the corner, looking over the crowd. I push people aside to get to her.

She laughs pleasantly. “It’s a riot every day, in here. Come on, it’s quieter upstairs.”

Indeed, it is quieter upstairs, but it is much hotter. I start sweating almost immediately. The air flow in this building is nonexistent and this room definitely has the worst of it. It doesn’t help that the floor is covered in rags and thin mattresses, making the insulation too strong.

I take off my overcoat. Vinnie smiles apologetically. “I forget about the heat sometimes. Sorry.”

She sits down on a mattress that looks cleaner than some of the others. I sit next to her.

“Thanks for coming to visit. I wasn’t sure you would make it,” She says.

I smile. “Of course I came. It’s been a long time. We were best friends before you left.”

She smirks. “I assume I’ve been replaced by Isaac at this point, correct?”

“I, uhh…” I’m not sure what to say to that.

She laughs. “God, Warren, you really haven’t changed! Don’t be so nervous! I like him. I’m glad things have worked out for you.”

“Thanks,” I reply.

We sit in companionable silence for a few moments. I look around the tiny, squalid room. As children, we both shared a room with our mothers at the manor where they worked as maids. The rooms were small, but mother had a bed and I had a cot. Both were perfectly comfortable and Vinnie’s arrangement was the same. As I grew older and started doing odd jobs around the manor, they put me in a room with several other boys where I had my first bed. A similar change in situation happened to Vinnie, she started working in the stables, caring for the houses, and she was given a little space in the loft to call her own. She loved it there. It was cool and airy and hers alone.

What a difference.

“Are you doing okay, Vinnie?” I ask.

She shrugs. “Well enough.” She sighs and places her chin in her hands. She smiles ruefully. “This place is not at all what I thought it would be.”

“What happened?”

She gestures helplessly at the room. “This. There’s no upward mobility. It’s not like Rivermire. I assumed it would be. Industrial revolutions tend to do that, you know, they create a space for people like you and me who just want something a little bit better than our parents had.” Her fist clenches. “But then Bloodworth took control of everything. There were mysterious deaths, officials who were encouraging literacy and opportunities for the poor. Gone, vanished, bodies found in sewers. The official report says they were attacked and killed by street gangs protesting his ideas. It’s bullshit.”

She stands to her feet and starts pacing, talking faster and faster and faster. “I came here to find hope and instead I found oppression. I can’t leave. All of the money I make working with Frellan, Kragnose, and Pollis, the dragons, goes straight into food, renting this place, taxes, and maybe some new clothes if I skip a few meals. I would have returned to Rivermire years ago if I could have just paid for a ride on the dragons I spend all day loving and caring for.”

She sits next to me again. She smiles, but God, she looks so, so tired.

“Sorry. I didn’t mean to regale you with my tale of woe. I’m the useless whiner now, I suppose. I’m just so angry, all the time now. I want it to stop.”

“I understand,” I say gently. It’s a lie. I don’t. Even when mother died, I don’t think I felt the despair I can see in her eyes. I knew mother was in a happier place, I knew I would be fine, I knew life would go on. I don’t think she has hope in anything or anyone.

“How long do you plan to stay?” Vinnie asks.

&lt;&lt;if $rebel &lt; 5&gt;&gt;
“I’m not sure,” I reply. “A couple weeks, perhaps?”

Vinnie bites her lip nervously. “Be careful. There will be some interesting developments in the next few weeks.”

“What do you mean?”

She stares at me for a long moment. Then she sighs and shrugs. “I just mean, be careful.”

She stands again. She grabs a vest off a peg nailed into the wall and throws it on over her shirt. 

“I’ve got to get to work. It was good to see you, Warren. Thanks for coming.” She leaps over some of the mattresses, but stops at the foot of the stairs.

She looks over her shoulder at me. “Please. I know you’re a good person, Warren. Please stay that way.”

Is she crying? She turns away and runs down the stairs.

“Vinnie, wait!” I quickly follow, but she has vanished into the crowd and I’m left standing amidst them, wondering what she could have meant and feeling like something terrible may happen at any moment.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
“I’m going to leave as soon as I can,” I say. “It will probably be a few weeks though.”

Vinnie raises an eyebrow quizzically. “Why can’t you just leave now?”

“I…” What to say to her? How could I possible explain all that transpired between Bloodworth and myself last night? Should I even tell her? That could put her in danger. “I just can’t. Something is keeping me here.”

“James Bloodworth,” Vinnie says.

“What?” I exclaim. “How did you know?”

She laughs. “If Bloodworth thinks he is the only one with spies, he must be more egotistical and delusional than I thought.”

“So you know? You know about the Rebirth Ball?”

“Yes,” Vinnie says. She stands suddenly and offers me her hand. “I’m glad to know you don’t support him. Come on, there’s some people I want you to meet.”

[[Follow Vinnie]]
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Follow Vinnie" tags="" position="146,2257" size="100,100">I take her hand and follow her.

We zigzag through the alleys until we reach a building that looks even more decrepit than the surrounding decrepit buildings. Vinnie knocks on the door- three times, pause, soft twice, three more times- and the door swings opens. It’s pitch dark in there. Vinnie takes me hand again and pulls me inside.

“Stairs,” She says.

She leads me down stairs. The darkness gets darker.

She knocks again, the same pattern as before. Another door swings open and light floods my vision, causing me to slam my eyes shut against the sudden stinging.
Once my eyes adjust, I can see that we stand in a simple, small room. There are a few chairs set up in a circle but nobody else is here.

“Commander Mynatt,” Vinnie says, snapping to a salute.

“Ms. Smith,” A cool voice says. A door, hidden in the wall, opens on the far side of the room. A tall, willowy middle-aged woman, wearing a dress that strangely looks militaristic with it’s smart metal buttons, sturdy material, and gold cuff and collar designs, steps into the room.

She pauses at the sight of me. “And a guest. Apparently.”

“This is my friend, Warren Lawson,” Vinnie says. “He is visiting from Rivermire.”

Mynatt smirks. “Visiting. Hardly.”

She prowls forward and offers me her hand. I take it and we shake, but she squeezes hard, threateningly. “Mary Eleanor Mynatt.”

“Warren Lawson,” I reply.

“What are you really doing in Stelstrom, Warren Lawson?”

“Visiting,” I reply.

She chuckles darkly. “Ah, Stelstrom. The vacation spot of the world, known for its hospitality and healthy atmosphere. Don’t insult me, child, you are not visiting.”

“He’s being attacked by James Bloodworth,” Vinnie says.

“Bloodworth?” Mynatt eyes me with more interest. “Bloodworth is after you?”

There’s no point in lying. If Vinnie knows the truth, if the rebellion has spies in the aristocracy, then Mynatt will realize sooner or later and she doesn’t look like the type of person one lies to easily.

“Yes,” I say. “He is.”

“How so?” Mynatt asks.

[[“He is forcing me to work for him. He wants me to help him wipe out the rebellion.”|Truth to Mynatt]]

“I agree,” Mynatt says. Finally, her face cracks into what must be a smile. “If you assist us, Mr. Lawson, I assure you that we will do our best to protect you from Bloodworth’s machinations. I can’t promise your safety. However, I can promise you the pride found in the truth that you are fighting for the righteous cause. That’s more than anything Bloodworth can offer you.”

Mynatt offers me her hand again and I shake it. She turns to Vinnie. “Make sure he returns to his hotel safely. We’ll be in contact.”

Vinnie salutes. She takes my hand and pulls me out of Mynatt’s presence. Mynatt is right. As I follow, deep down, I can feel that I am doing the right thing. I just know it.

Mynatt offers me her hand again and I shake it. She turns to Vinnie. “Make sure he returns to his hotel safely. We’ll be in contact.”

Vinnie salutes. She takes my hand and pulls me out of Mynatt’s presence. I’m uneasy. This rebellion is exactly what I thought it would be.

I wish life could be black and white, good and bad, happiness and sadness like in all of the stories. I wish I weren’t trapped in the middle of it all, trying to muddle my way through. I wish life could be simple.

“Good morning, gentlemen,” Bloodworth says drolly to what is, I’m sure, a very stupid look on my face.
 
“Sorry, sir,” I say. I open the door wider. “Please come in.”
 
Bloodworth nods, amused. “Much obliged.” He enters our hotel room, removing his top hat and hanging it on a stand. Two uniformed guards carrying bayonets follow him.
 
“Yes, your rooms seem adequate,” He says. “Ah! Mr. Summers!” He approaches Isaac and shakes his hand vigorously. “Still in your sleep clothes, I see.”
 
Isaac’s face turns bright red, a bizarre contrast with the purple. “I just woke up, sorry.”
 
Bloodworth waves away his apology. “No need to apologize. Enjoy yourself while you’re here.” He turns to me. “Unfortunately, I’m afraid Mr. Lawson cannot do the same.”
 
I glance at the guards. They stare straight ahead with matching, imperious expressions.
 
“Is there something you would like me to do?” I ask.
 
“Yes,” Bloodworth says. “Upon arrival, did you meet the stablehand at the dragon towers?”
 
He knows about Vinnie? I blanche for a second, then stammer an answer.

[[“Yes, I did.”|Knew Vinnie][$obeyBloodworth to $obeyBloodworth + 1]]
[[“I don’t believe so.”|Didn&#39;t know Vinnie]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Knew Vinnie" tags="" position="527,2481" size="100,100">I can’t think of anything else to say. Besides, the fact that he asked the question means he clearly already knows the answer. Lying would get me, and Vinnie, nowhere.
 
Bloodworth takes a seat next to Isaac. His guards move to stand behind him. He gestures to the seat in front of him and I take it, nowhere else to go.
 
“I heard she grew up in the same manor you did, with mothers under similar circumstances.”
 
I nod. I’m not going to supply any more information than I need to, not where Vinnie is concerned.
 
Bloodworth observes me. “Were you close?”
 
I shrug.
 
“Clearly, you were,” Bloodworth says. “Or else you would be speaking.”
 
I stare at him. “What would you like me to do? Why are you here?”
 
The guards shift, ever so subtly, to facing me. One readjusts his grip on his gun.
 
My tone was hostile, but I can’t help it.
 
“I have reason to believe she is in contact, indeed, is a confidante of sorts, for the rebellion leader, Mary Eleanor Mynatt.” Bloodworth says, “I want you to go to the stables today, reconnect with her, and then convince her to allow you to join the rebellion. I need inside information on them, and, as I said last night, you are in an ideal position to provide that.”

“She would never join the rebellion,” I say. “She came to Stelstrom looking for success. She won’t find that through a rebellion, and she’d know that.”
 
“People can change,” Bloodworth says. “Perhaps you don’t know her anymore.”
 
“She was acting a bit odd, Warren,” Isaac says.
 
I glare at him. He doesn’t seem to notice. I turn back to Bloodworth. “I know she wouldn’t do this,” I say.
 
“Are you implying my intel is incorrect?” Bloodworth says. “That I have an inadequate means of knowing about my own citizens?”
 
“Of course not!” Isaac exclaims. “I think Warren’s just finding it hard to believe, that’s all.”
 
Bloodworth nods thoughtfully, then stands. “That’s none of my concern. You will go to the stables this afternoon and then you will report to me everything that happens. If you choose not to… well…” He gazes around the hotel room, stares at Isaac, and then takes an apple off the table. He takes a bite as it as he smiles at me.
 
He leaves, guards marching behind him.

Bloodworth smirks. He’s silent for a long moment, just staring at me, like a hawk watching a mouse. “Well then,” He stands to his feet. “Go to the stables this afternoon. Ask to see Frellan the dragon. You’ll run into the stablehand, I’m sure. Report back to me what you find and any information you might find out.”

“Excellent,” Bloodworth says. “Report back to me after you go.”
 
He leaves, the guards trailing behind him.

[[Head to Stables|Stables]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Stables" tags="" position="562,2781" size="100,100">I find the stables. I take a steam-lift to one of the highest floors, wondering what I could possibly say to Vinnie. I’m a terrible liar. I’m a good friend. I’m not going to betray, but I have no idea how to save her.
 
The lift stops moving and a bell dings. I open the rail gate and step onto the floor. Massive stalls line the walkway. A green dragon peers over one and snorts at me, sparks flying from its nose. I wonder if that’s the dragon Isaac and I rode yesterday.
 
“Vinnie?” I call.
 
From the other end of the hall, a paperboy cap-clad head pokes out of one of the stalls.
 
“Warren? What the hell?” She says. She comes out of the stall and jogs down the hall to me. “What are you doing here?”
 
“I…” I really should have thought this through before I came. “I want to talk to you.”
 
She glances over her shoulder. Another dragon looks out over the stall she exited, an expression that looks almost disdainful on its face. “I’m working right now, Warren. Besides, we shouldn’t be seen in public like this.”
 
Before I can make up a story, her face hardens and she whips back around to me. “Wait. What’s going on? You’re not stupid. You would never come here.” Her voice lowers. “Did Bloodworth send you?”

[[“Yes, he did.”|Sent by Bloodworth Truth]]
 
[[“No, he didn’t.”|Sent by Bloodworth Lie]]

“So he knows about me? He knows we’re friends?”
 
I nod.
 
Vinnie pulls her cap off and runs her hands through her short hair. “What does he want?”

[[Tell her the truth - he wanted me to spy on her and the rebellion so that he could destroy them.|Sent to Spy]]

Vinnie sighs and crosses her arms. She rocks back and forth on her heels. “Sorry, I’ve just been paranoid that he is watching me. You never know, these days.” She pauses. “So, what did you want to talk about?”
 
“The rebellion,” I say. “I want to talk to you about the rebellion.”

&lt;&lt;if $regime &gt; $rebel&gt;&gt;\
“Vinnie, you have to see that this rebellion is futile. It puts you and everyone else in danger.”
 
Vinnie shrugs. “It’s better to live in danger than to survive oppressed. I’d rather risk everything for the hope of a better life than remain passive.”
 
“Fine, but what about everyone else? What about the other poor people?”
 
“A rebellion is the best thing for them!” Vinnie exclaimed indignantly.
 
“I’m not convinced of that,” I reply. “Look, I’m sorry, I’m just concerned for you. You could get hurt.”
 
“Stop being a useless whiner, Warren! That’s none of your concern.”
 
“It is my concern!” I exclaim. “We’re friends. Of course it is my concern whether you live or die.”
 
She shakes her head. “Look, if you’re so worried, everything will be over tomorrow. Mynatt is about to do something so stupid that it will effectively cripple the rebellion for months.”
 
“What is she doing?”
 
“I’m not telling you that,” Vinnie replies. “But I will say this, stay away from Bloodworth Manor tomorrow. Stay far away.” She steps away from me. “I have to go to work. I thank you for your concern, Warren, but it is really unnecessary.” She turns and leaves. I’m left standing alone.

[[Return to Hotel]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
“You are right about one thing though. Bloodworth is dangerous. I need to get away from him as soon as possible, so please, what can I do to help the rebellion succeed.”
 
Vinnie smiles hugely at that. She glances over her shoulder, checks that no one is there, and then takes my hand and pulls me into one of the dragon stalls. The dragon, another green one, eats from an enormous bucket in the corner and pays us no mind.
 
“I hate this idea, but Mynatt is planning on an attack on Bloodworth Manor.” Vinnie shakes her head. “It’s illogical and impractical, but she’s dead-set on it. If, however, we could get someone to allow us to sneak inside the manor, the plan just might work. Would you do that for us?”

[[&quot;Yes.&quot;|Help with Attack]]

“He wants me to convince you to let me join the rebellion and then, naturally, he wants information.”
 
Vinnie huffs a laugh. “I was way ahead of him, on that. Does he know I talked to you about that?”
 
“I don’t think so, no.” I sigh and notice myself mimicking her movement, shoving a hand through my hair. “Vinnie, this is dangerous. I don’t know what the right option is, but I have to tell him something and I have to protect you.”
 
Vinnie shakes her head. “You don’t have to protect me, Warren, that’s not your responsibility. Independence and self-preservation is why I am fighting this rebellion in the first place. The government ought to let us the freedom of personal responsibility.”
 
“You don’t get it!” I burst out. She stops and stares at me. I try to gather my thoughts. “This isn’t about governments and ethics and large faceless of people. We’re friends. I can’t just let you die, I can’t just let him kill you. I don’t know the best way to go about it though.”
 
Vinnie is quiet for a moment, then she says. “I’m not going to change anything about my actions. If Bloodworth wants to kill me, fine. I’ll be a martyr for the people. But what are you going to tell him?”
 
“I don’t know,” I say. “I have to tell him something and this conversation has been supremely unhelpful.”
 
Vinnie laughs a bit at that, but then she pauses, looking serious, sad. Finally, she says, “I shouldn’t do this, I really shouldn’t do this. But…” she takes a deep breath. “The rebels are planning to attack Bloodworth manor tomorrow night. I was against this plan from the start, but Mynatt pushed for it. Hearing about you seemed to have reignited her hatred for the man. If you tell him this information, the rebels won’t be harmed. Bloodworth Manor has a defense mechanism that can successfully keep people out. More people would die had I said nothing to you, so you can tell him. You can.” She sounds like she is trying to convince herself of the fact.
 
“Okay,” I say. “Thank you.”
 
Without another word, she turns and walks away, back to her dragon.

&lt;&lt;set $obeyBloodworth += 1&gt;&gt;\
“He suspects you,” I say. “He wants to know where you stand and, if you are with the rebels, he wants me to use you to find information about them.”
 
Vinnie looks skeptical. “It seems odd that he would suspect a nobody stable-hand.”
 
“He seems very thorough,” I say. “He researched everything about me. He knew we lived at the same manor in Rivermire. I think he was just trying to find anyone I had a connection to who could possibly give me a lead into the rebels.”
 
Vinnie nods slowly. She kicks at a clump of hay on the ground. “Well. You’ve talked to me. What do you think you are going to tell him?”
 
“I’m not sure,” I answer honestly. “But what I do know is that I am not going to let him hurt you. You should run, leave, while you can.”
 
She shakes her head. “I’m not leaving. Never. If you care about the rebellion at all, you’d know why I can’t.”
 
“I care about keeping people alive,” I say. “You’ve got to give me something to tell him.”
 
She’s silent for a long moment.  Finally, she says, “I shouldn’t do this, I really shouldn’t do this. But…” she takes a deep breath. “The rebels are planning to attack Bloodworth manor tomorrow night. I was against this plan from the start, but Mynatt pushed for it.

More people would die had I said nothing to you, so you can tell him. You can.” She sounds like she is trying to convince herself of the fact.
 
I nod. “Thank you, Vinnie.”
 
She smiles, then spins suddenly and practically bolts back down the hall into the stall with the dragon.

“Brilliant!” Vinnie exclaims. “Thank you, Warren! We’ll get in touch with you via pigeon to find out the details.” Something shuffles in the hall outside. “I have to get back to work now. Thanks for coming though!”

“Why not?” Vinnie asks.
 
“It’s too risky,” I say. “Besides, attacking a private home? In the aristocratic part of town? No insider could provide enough information to make that plan work.”
 
“I suppose that’s true,” Vinnie says. “I just… I know the plan is stupid. I tried to put a stop to it, but Mynatt won’t listen. The only way to end it now would be to either have it be successful, we capture Bloodworth Manor, or if Bloodworth knew we were coming and implemented his mysterious defense mechanisms. Otherwise, a lot of people are going to die. You have to care about that, Warren, you have to.”
 
“I do,” I say. “But I just don’t know what to do about it.”
 
“Help us,” Vinnie says.
 
“I’d like to help you, Vinnie, but I don’t trust Mynatt. At all.”
 
“I know. That’s why you ought to help this plan,” Vinnie says. “Please, just let me get in contact with you to see what you think then.”
 
I nod. “I suppose that’s fine. But be careful, Vinnie. Please.”
 
“I always am,” She says. With that, she replaces her cap, tips it to me, and then leaves the stall. I’m left alone.

[[Return to Hotel]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Return to Hotel" tags="" position="641,3298" size="100,100">I stop by the hotel and pick up Isaac, now in his uniform (mismatched again) instead of his silk pajamas. We leave and begin making our way to Bloodworth Manor. Isaac complains about not ordering a carriage, but I’m not really listening.
 
When I reach the manor, when I am face to face with Bloodworth, what will I say? My options are limited. I can either tell him the information I gathered from Vinnie or I can not. If I do, I risk destroying the rebellion and incriminating Vinnie. If I don’t, the rebellion may be destroyed anyway and I may incriminate myself along with Vinnie. There’s so much confusion, so much unknown, it’s as if the steam and smog from above has seeped into my very thoughts and forced my own consciousness to stumble, staggering for something solid to hold on to.
 
I focus on my surroundings, attempting to clear the mental fog away, but it doesn’t help. Illustrious mansions line the street, each one more opulent and sleek and beautiful than the last. I think of the tenement buildings I saw, so disgusting and crumbling and packed. How can something so distinctly binary ever become something less so?
 
The walk does not provide an answer. Isaac and I arrive at the Manor. I give my name to the butler and he invites us into a sitting room. It has the same reflective sleekness as the ballroom from the night before, even the furniture has the quality. I sit on a sofa and am filled with bizarre satisfaction that the couch is definitely not comfortable. Even Bloodworth can’t have everything,
 
The thought it petty, a truth made all the more clear the minute Bloodworth, in his casual charismatic way, strolls into the room. He smiles when he sees us.
 
“Mr. Summers and Mr. Lawson. You two are quickly becoming regulars in my life, are you not?”
 
I attempt to smile. “Sir, I went to the stables. I spoke with the stablehand.”
 
“Excellent!” Bloodworth seats himself in the chair opposite ours. I notice, begrudgingly, that his chair has a cushion instead of the metal of our couch. Apparently, he can have everything.
 
“Tell me everything,” he says. “What did you discover?”
 
I take a deep breath. I think about what I want to tell him, and then I reply.

[[“The rebels intend to attack the manor tomorrow.”|Tell of Attack]]
[[“Vinnie did not know the rebels’ plans.”|Didn&#39;t Know Plans]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Tell of Attack" tags="" position="397,3449" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $regime += 1&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;set $disobeyBloodworth += 1&gt;&gt;\
Bloodworth rubs his chin. “Is that so?”
 
I nod. “She was very clear, sir.”
 
“That’s a rather stupid plan,” he replies. He glances at me suspiciously.
 
“She was clear on that point as well. This is an action instigated by Mynatt, their leader,” I say. Isaac stares at me, wide-eyed. I told him nothing at the hotel nor on the walk here. I must seem like a monster to him, seemingly betraying my friend so nonchalantly.
 
Bloodworth stands suddenly. “Come with me,” He says.
 
He leads us out of the sitting room, through several maze-like halls, up some stairs, and out onto a balcony. It overlooks the large courtyard I had noticed the night before. The gate at the far end, the only entrance, allows an unobstructed view of the street through its bars while the balcony’s height provides a good view of this part of the city. He points ahead, at a tower.
 
“That’s the stable,” He says.
 
“Ah,” I reply. I’m not really sure what he is on about.
 
“I have allowed whispers and rumors to escape my modest manor concerning the defense mechanisms available here should an attack occur,” Bloodworth chuckles darkly. “It’s the dragons.”
 
“What?” Isaac asks.
 
“Sir?” I repeat, though a sinking feeling begins drowning my emotions.
 
“The dragons suddenly became tame, did they? No. That stable is pumped with a chemically altered steam that calms them, like a drug. They’re addicted to it now. Take it away, and poof! They’ll go berserk. And they’ll come to the first place they catch a scent of it- this manor. They’ll destroy everyone in their path.”
 
He turns and walks back into the manor. “Let them come.”

“I find that shocking,” Bloodworth says. “She knew nothing?”
 
“Nothing,” I repeat.
 
“We know for a fact that she is a rebel,” Bloodworth says. “And we know for a fact that you two spoke at length.”
 
I force myself not to shiver at that fact. It shouldn’t come as a surprise to me. He has spies everywhere. But did this spy hear anything? Is the spy still following Vinnie?
 
“We spoke, but she wouldn’t even allow me to join the rebels. She said my government affiliation was difficult to trust.” I’m hoping, desperately praying to any god that might hear, that he buys this, that my normal incapability of lying does not destroy me and, more importantly, Vinnie.
 
“Well,” Bloodworth says. “You two may have become regulars within the past few days, but certainly not welcome ones.”
 
He stands and begins storming towards the door, but just before reaching for the knob, he spins suddenly, grabs Isaac by the collar, and presses a pistol to his head.
 
“No! Stop!” I exclaim, leaping to my feet.
 
Isaac remains perfectly still. He casts me a terrified look.
 
“Tell me the truth,” Bloodworth says calmly.
 
I look into Isaac’s terrified face. So afraid. So afraid for Vinnie, but Isaac. Isaac.

I tell him everything. I tell him about the rebels’ plan, about Vinnie’s involvement, about the rumors concerning the defense mechanism, everything. When I’m finally done, breathing heavy and eyes strained from staring, unblinkingly, at Isaac, Bloodworth drops him.
 
“You have turned out more disappointing than I would have assumed,” Bloodworth says. “Your mother was made of sterner stuff.”
 
The hell does that mean?
 
Bloodworth kicks Isaac in the side. Isaac grunts and scrambles away, standing next to me. Bloodworth aims his gun at both of us, but then freezes. He stares at something behind us. I look and see a massive throng of people shaking the gates of Bloodworth Manor, all wearing rags, all poor.
 
The rebels.
 
He turns and runs from the room, leaving Isaac and I alone on the balcony.

“I don’t care, it’s true!” I say.
 
Bloodworth opens his mouth, but then freezes. He stares at something beyond me. Shouts and screams and yells fill the air. I turn and see out the window a massive throng of people shaking the gates of Bloodworth Manor, all wearing rags, all poor.

I turn back around. Bloodworth tosses Isaac to the ground and runs out of the room, leaving us alone.

“Oh, it will probably be for me, at my dinner party next week as I retell the events of tomorrow,” He replies. He retakes his seat and smiles. “The rebels will be destroyed and the city will finally have peace.”
 
“Hundreds of people will die!”
 
“You sound like you sympathize with them, Lawson.” He leans forward, expression suddenly dangerous. “Tell me, why don’t you want me to kill all of those people?”

“Isaac, can you go entertain Lord Bloodworth? I need a moment,” I say.
 
Isaac nods. “Of course. You’re doing great, Warren.” He claps me on the back and then leaves the balcony.
 
“Come on, come on,” I mumble, scanning across the courtyard. I hear a chirp sound from above and I look up. A pigeon lands next to me, giving me a quizzical look.
 
“Yes!” I exclaim. I pull my journal out of my pocket, rip out a page from the end, and scribble a note detailing the dragon defenses to the rebels on it. I attach it to the pigeon’s leg and off he flies.
 
I turn to go back inside.
 
Bloodworth stands right there, Isaac next to him, a pistol pressed against his head.
 
“What did you just send, boy?” Bloodworth says.
 
Isaac’s eyes plead with me. I’m too stunned. I was so worried for Vinnie. I hadn’t been concerned for Isaac. Isaac, with a pistol pressed to his temple.
 
“What did you send?” Bloodworth asks again, completely calm.
 
“I sent a letter,” I whisper.
 
“To whom?” Bloodworth asks.

“Beg pardon?” Bloodworth says.

“What should we do?” Isaac yells. “Follow Bloodworth?”
 
“Why the hell would we do that?” I reply. “He just tried to kill you!”
 
Isaac stops running, slowing to a jog and then standing still. He pants for a moment, then says, “True. But I imagine he has a way to survive something like this. Following him would be our best bet.”
 
I shake my head slowly. I can’t. I can’t follow Bloodworth, hoping against hope to survive. I know where my allegiance stands, I know what I believe to be right.
 
“Isaac, I can’t,” I say. I hesitate, knowing the next sentence could ruin my career and, more importantly, my friendship with Isaac forever. “I have to—”
 
“Warren!” Someone yells.
 
I turn. Vinnie grins, waves, and pulls herself in through a window.
 
“What, how did, why…?” Isaac stammers for words. “This is the second floor!” Isaac finally says.
 
Vinnie shakes her head. “Third floor, actually. You really need to keep track of where you are.” She focuses on me. “Mynatt sent me ahead to sneak into the house, if possible. We need to get you out. Is there any information we can use?”
 
Isaac crosses his arm. “Nice try Vinnie, but Warren isn’t fighting for the rebels. He stands for the law.”
 
Vinnie turns back to me. “You didn’t tell him?”
 
Isaac freezes. His gaze slowly shifts until he’s staring at me, trying so hard to be stoic but hurting inside, I can tell.
 
“Isaac…” I say.
 
“You’re for them? You’re for the rebels?” He questions.
 
“I just have to do what I believe is right. You can come with me, you can help me change Stelstrom.”
 
Isaac backs away. “No. No. You and I, we always upheld the law. We always believed that justice would eventually win out.”
 
“That’s what’s happening,” I say. “But we have to help it. We have to help the rebellion.”
 
Isaac’s expression hardens. “No. No, you’re different than I thought. You’re different.” He points at Vinnie. “Go on. Go on with her. I’ll find my own way out of this.”
 
“Isaac!” I say.
 
“No!” He shouts. “Just go!” He turns and runs, around a corner, into the endless halls.
 
“Isaac!” I start to follow him.
 
“No!” Vinnie grabs my arm. “We have to go, now! Mynatt could use any information you have.” She starts to tug on my arm towards the window, then pauses. “It’s also the best chance to save Isaac. If we can get in, make the place surrender…”
 
“You’re right. Take me to her,” I say.
 
Vinnie nods, takes my hand, and we run for the window. She helps me scale the wall, but despite never having done so before, I don’t pay much attention to her instructions. My thoughts are filled with Isaac, the choices I’ve made, and the consequences that may follow.

I nod at his reasoning, but I can’t shake the fear that the rebels would be searching for him. Being near Bloodworth might be a death sentence, especially for Isaac. I can’t lose him.
 
“Warren!” Someone shouts.
 
I turn. Vinnie leans into the hall from a window. She grins, waves, drops to the floor, and sprints up to us.
 
“What, how did, why…?” Isaac stammers for words. “This is the second floor!” Isaac finally says.
 
Vinnie shakes her head. “Third floor, actually. You really need to keep track of where you are.”
 
“You’re with the rebels!” Isaac accuses.
 
Vinnie shrugs. “Obviously. Look, join us and I can get you out of here. I can bring you to safety!”
 
Isaac looks at me. I shake my head slowly. “I can’t,” I whisper.
 
Vinnie glares at me. “Why not?”
 
“Because I don’t believe it’s the right thing to do,” I say. I gesture towards Isaac. “But if you want to get to safety, I won’t stop you.”
 
“No, never,” Isaac says. “I’m not leaving you.”
 
Vinnie looks back and forth between us, her glare and anger morphing into a frown and hurt. “Warren… please…”
 
“I’m sorry,” I say.
 
She takes a deep breath. She watches the ground for a long moment, then she straightens her shoulders. “There’s no changing your mind, I suppose.”
 
I smile ruefully. “No. I won’t change my mind.”
 
“I’ll stop being a useless whiner then,” Vinnie says. She tries to smile, but her lip is quivering. I pretend not to see. “Stay good, please, Warren.”
 
“I’ll do my best,” I say.
 
She squeezes my hand, then bolts from the hall and out the window, leaving Isaac and I in the hall.

I do not wish to describe the details seen and heard and tasted throughout the battle. My work in law enforcement did not prepare me for the lawlessness of human battle, strife against strife and horror against horror.
 
The dragons came, soon after. They burned hundreds of rebels, scorching fire engulfing their screaming, writhing bodies. Then they went for the manor, landing upon the roof and burning the immaculate building. I watched in horror from a corner of the courtyard as the manor went up in flames, the manor I had stood in only moments before. Vinnie beckoned me to follow her, but I could not.
 
My thoughts were of Isaac and Isaac alone.
 
I pulled away from her and ran back inside, scaling the same wall and entering through the window. I dashed through the halls as the air filled with evil smoke, threatening to scorch and choke the breath from my life. I found Isaac lying face down in a hall. I grabbed his body, unknowing if he were dead or alive, and dragged him from the danger. I exited the house.
 
Thankfully, Isaac began coughing and wheezing as I carried him through the courtyard. He mumbled curses at me, and insults, but I didn’t care. He was safe.
 
We made it back to the rebels, who were regrouping. Mynatt was preparing another attack.
 
I stepped in front of her, snatched the quill pen from her hand, and snapped it in two.
 
I gave a speech. I don’t remember much of the details of the speech, those must have been replaced with the stuff of nightmares I recall most vividly from the battle, but it must have been passionate, rousing, patriotic, etc. etc. because the rebels turned from Mynatt and began following me. I ordered a full retreat. We left for the hideout.
 
Mynatt was livid, but so many died in her name and even she could not deny it. I had her stand trial and she condemned for abuse of her power. An election was held for a new leader, and Vinnie was chosen almost unanimously. She selected me as her right hand.
 
During all of this, Isaac refused to speak to me. He was kept in a room, alone, not because of our designations, but because of his. I tried to speak with him, to explain myself, to tell jokes, I even referred to this journal as a diary, but to no avail. He barely acted like he heard me.
 
The rebels and the aristocrats continued to fight, Bloodworth leading the counterattack. But then, we got him.
 
Vinnie successfully figured out how to truly tame the dragons. Every night, she would sneak into the stables (she had long lost her job there, of course) and would retrain the dragons in obedience to her. When the rebels attacked Bloodworth Manor again, the estate was defenseless.
 
I stopped the killing of Bloodworth. He stood trial, and was sentenced to life work inside a steam factory. Poetic, in a way.
 
The remaining aristocrats fell in line. Vinnie and I established a democratic system of government. It took some time, but everything began to work itself out. I have been elected Head of Law Enforcement several times over at this point, and I am content.
 
Isaac returned to Rivermire and also became Head of Law Enforcement there. I have not spoken to him. Relations between Stelstrom and Rivermire are tense.
 
I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know that for now, I am content.
&lt;/div&gt;\

I watched in horror from a corner of the courtyard as the manor went up in flames, the manor I had stood in only moments before. Vinnie beckoned me to follow her. I did so. I would find out later that Isaac died, choking on the dragon smoke, his lungs filling with charred breath.
 
I imagine it incessantly. I have nightmares. Isaac, I am so sorry.
 
The battle was a disaster. Mynatt ordered another attack, and all who attempted so died in the flames of the dragons. Seeing almost all of the rebels burned or burning, Mynatt ordered a retreat. We did so.
 
At the hideout, Vinnie screamed and shouted at Mynatt, berating her, calling her a fool, tears running down her face. Mynatt was silent. When Vinnie’s voice choked into a raspy whisper, her words all spent, Mynatt struck her with a metal rod and knocked her to the ground. I rushed to her defense. Mynatt let me carry Vinnie out of the room.
 
Vinnie has never been the same. She can’t talk. She can’t even really move. She just stares. She whimpers sometimes, a keening whine.
 
I left the rebellion. There was no one there. There is no one in my life now. I write this from an alley, beneath a roof made of cloth. Mynatt and Bloodworth, who survived, of course, search for me. I’ve heard rumors they have sent assassins.
 
I imagine it would be strange to be assassinated.

The dragons came. I did not see them, but I heard them and I sure as hell felt them. Their roars and screeches grew as the yells and shouts of the rebel silenced. I heard the crash of their feet and felt the shaking of the manor as they landed upon the roof. They spat fire upon the manor, and flames soon cracked and licked at our heels as Isaac and I flew through the halls.
 
We managed to find Bloodworth, by sheer luck. He had built an underground passage and he allowed us to use it to escape. We did so.
 
At the end of the passage was a spacious and comfortable dining room. A servant greeted us on the other side and brought us tea and scones. Around the table, Bloodworth told me the most shocking news. I was his son. Mother had worked as a maid for his family. When I asked if he had loved her, he laughed a laugh that sounded more like a dragon’s roar.
 
What would she think of me? I ate my scone, despite the fact that I thought I could hear still hear the screams of hundreds of burning corpses. The scone tasted like blueberries.
 
Isaac didn’t eat anything.
 
After the “battle”, could it even be called such a thing, Bloodworth quickly rebuilt his manor. He invited Isaac and I to live with him. We did so. Bloodworth started a campaign to snuff out the remaining rebels. We assisted. Bloodworth publicly executed hundreds more rebels, some were children. We watched.
 
The next day, Isaac had vanished. Bloodworth and I thought he had been kidnapped, but after weeks of searching, we found him again. He was working with the rebels. He and Vinnie took over leadership and together began gaining momentum. For years, we fought. I and Bloodworth in the attempt to create some form of peace in the city, and Isaac and Vinnie in the attempt to stir up hatred and discontent among all they came in contact with.
 
With an ironic sense of both shame and bittersweetness, I noted in the tabloids one day that a common rumor said they got married. This rumor was confirmed true when Isaac, Vinnie, and their infant child were captured during a raid. Bloodworth executed them all.
 
That killed the rebellion. It also killed Bloodworth- he was found dead in his bedroom, stabbed over and over and over until he did not even look like a human. Nobody knows who did it.
 
Sometimes, I wonder if it was me.
 
Bloodworth named me sole heir of all of his titles and estates. I rule Stelstrom now. It’s peaceful, and the people hate me.
 
I feel the same.
&lt;/div&gt;\

At the end of the passage was a spacious and comfortable dining room. A servant greeted us on the other side and brought us tea and scones. Bloodworth sat at the table and invited us to join him.
 
I was disgusted. Down the tunnel, hundreds of people were dying. Bloodworth daintily sipped his tea.
 
I demanded to know how to stop the dragons. Bloodworth chuckled, but he told me how to release the steam that would calm them. He said if I chose to do so, I had to deal with the fallout entirely. I agreed.
 
Isaac and I journeyed through the tunnels until we found the vault Bloodworth had mentioned. Inside the vault was a strange, chimney-like mechanism and, after much tinkering, cajoling, shouting, and frustration, Isaac finally got the mechanism to function by kicking it. He broke his toe, but it was well worth it. The mechanism functioned and released the steam, calming the dragons and giving the rebels enough time to escape.
 
The next day, Bloodworth brought Isaac and I before a council of aristocrats. He told of our “failures” in the battle and then made me Head of Law Enforcement. The crowd laughed.
 
They did not remain laughing for long.
 
I quit funneling their taxes into military and instead funded housing, education, and community programs designed to assist in the needs necessary for specific areas. I cut criminalization for being a rebel and instead designated it as a new political party, giving it the right to appear in debates and in court as a public entity rather than a vigilante as long as its leader adhered to democratic standards. This quickly brought the end of Mynatt’s reign and Vinnie was voted as the new leader.
 
It was an absolute pleasure watching her debate Bloodworth in a public hearing.
 
Popular opinion concerning the rebels among the aristocracy shifted, and soon, Bloodworth had no supporters. He tried to kill me once, but the assassins were thwarted. That’s a perk of living in a manor, I suppose, there are a lot of eyes watching out for you. He was put on trial for the attempt, found guilty, and sentenced to heavily managed community service for the rest of his life, spending his nights in a refurnished slum with other convicts and his days clearing muck and trash from underdeveloped areas.
 
Isaac left eventually, returning to Rivermire to accomplish the same feats. I could not have done it without him. He writes occasionally, but it was only recently that I learned that he writes to Vinnie far more often than he writes to me. I intend to mock him concerning the fact, but I’m honestly not upset at all about it. However, it’s what he deserves after referring to this journal as a diary for so long.
 
My life is busy, but well. I am looking forward to the next chapter of it.
