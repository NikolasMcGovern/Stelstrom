&lt;div class=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;\
Long ago, Stelstrom was known as the crown of Knoll, the pride of the city-states, the safehaven of the lost, the glory of peoples, etc., etc.. Think of a meaningless moniker and Stelstrom was probably known as it. As a child, teachers told me stories of the feats accomplished by the heroes and princes and geniuses of the city, their eyes wide and gestures emphatic. As I grew older, when steam and smoke and slavery spread across Knoll, they started whispering. Eventually, the stories were silenced.

Mother never spoke of Stelstrom. What would she think of me now?
&lt;/div&gt;\

“God, you’re so dramatic!”

I jump at the sudden interruption.

“Whoa, don’t fall!” Isaac grabs my arm, holding me steady. “Though to be fair, ‘Death by Dragon Fall’ would be an appropriately dramatic entry into your little diary, wouldn’t it?”

I try to glare at him over my shoulder, but I can’t for long. Isaac’s mischievous grin, wild curls flying in the wind, and mismatched uniform (navy overcoat with black trousers) strikes such an incongruent picture with the quintessential dragon-rider of stories, that it’s impossible to even feign frustration.

“Stop reading over my shoulder,” I grouse halfheartedly. I shrug my arm out of his grasp and face forward, pressing my dog-eared journal against the dragon’s back. I finish my entry.

I’m almost there.

Closing the notebook, I reach to place it into the case secured to the saddle. It’s awkward- I have to twist almost completely around because both of my legs are slung lady-style over one side of the dragon- but I manage to undo the leather flap and lift the lid, slipping it inside. As I do, my hands brush against a loose sheet of paper.

The letter.

My heart pounds, as it has every time I’ve touched that bloody scrap since the day it arrived.

I can’t help it. I grab it.

“Dragons above, Warren! You aren’t going to read that stupid thing again, are you?” Isaac groans. “I’m bored. Talk to me!”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Read Letter" tags="" position="336,350" size="100,100">“It’s a bit difficult to talk at this height, Isaac,” I reply. As gently as I can, I shift forward, letter in hand, and open the envelope.

I ignore the seal still attached. I memorized its design weeks ago. A dragon scale surrounded by steam set in red wax. Holding to it tightly, I stare at the handwriting, just letting the pointed, decisive strokes swirl across my vision. Gulping, I press the letter to the green scales of the dragon, feeling the tense movement of muscles beneath my hands with every wing-flap, and begin to read.

&lt;div class=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;\
To the Honorable Mr. Warren Lawson, Ministry of Law Enforcement, Rivermire

Your talents and efficiencies have become known across the hills of Knoll to my attention, here in the good city of Stelstrom. A man of your proficiencies could be well-set in a position here, protecting the people from crime and mongrels. Despite our (many) differences, peace is, of course, something valued by the citizens of Rivermire and of Stelstrom alike. I request your presence at the Rebirth Ball hosted at mine own manor. There, we can further discuss your future. One guest is permitted you.

I trust you will not disappoint. Be prompt.

Regards,
Lord J. Bloodworth, All Ministries, Stelstrom
&lt;/div&gt;\

If I’m known to Bloodworth, he is certainly known to me. After the dragon-taming and steam revolution within Stelstrom, James Bloodworth quickly rose from being one of the more unobtrusive aristocrats to, essentially, the head of everything within the city. Most of what I know of the man comes from the word around the Ministry of Law Enforcement. His methods are… effective.

I would not be able to sleep at night.

Though, I’ve not been able to do that since the letter arrived.

What could he want?

[[Slip the letter into my case]]
[[Slip the letter into my pocket]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Talk to Issac" tags="" position="487,350" size="100,100">Taking a deep breath, I nod. He’s right. I replace the letter into the case and secure the lid. “What do you want to talk about?”

“Uhhhh…” Isaac says. He shifts behind me, knocking into my back with his bony elbow. I chuckle and shake my head. He’s probably hastily scanning the countryside beneath as if it can give him some conversational tidbits.

I’m glad I ignored the urge to read the letter again. I close my eyes. The wind whips into my face, pleasantly cool and brisk, and a for a second, I pretend I’m one of those knights that Isaac looks so unlike. I know I look nothing like them too, but God, at least my uniform matches. I open my eyes and look down.

Rolling grassy hills, meadows of yellow poppies, farm houses, and grain fields fly beneath us. We pass over a lake and in the sparkling depths I get a view of the carrier dragon. It’s a standard Green Mid, but for someone who grew up in Rivermire, he may as well have been the most magnificent Red Fire. Widespread dragon-riding is a relatively new development. It’s all thanks to Stelstrom.

“Your mom!” Isaac exclaims.

“What?” I ask.

“Let’s talk about your mom! You mentioned her in your diary.”

“Journal,” I correct. “And there’s not much to tell.”

“Warren, we’ve been friends for five years now and—”

“Are we friends? Really?”

“—and, shut up, and I think a good heart-to-heart is more than overdue!”

I sigh. He’s insufferable. “It won’t be much of a heart-to-heart because there’s not much to tell. She grew up in Stelstrom but moved to Rivermire right before having me. She raised me, loved me, and then caught the steamthroat disease and died right before I started at the Ministry.”

Isaac is silent. That came out a bit more snappish than I had intended.

\
I slip the letter into the case. Once we arrive, it might be better to keep the letter away from pickpockets. If the criminals of the city find out I’m, apparently, affiliated with Bloodworth, I doubt I’ll make it to the Rebirth Ball in one piece.

\
I slip the letter into my pocket. I can’t risk losing this letter when it might be the only key I have to entering Bloodworth’s manor. And if I don’t arrive at the manor I doubt I’ll be able to survive Bloodworth’s wrath in one piece.

[[Continue|Arrival]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Arrival" tags="" position="412,668" size="100,100">“Sorry,” Isaac says. “I just—”

He stops midsentence. I glance up.

Stelstrom looms before us.

Massive black towers, steam bellowing from the top, dominate the horizon and the hills. Red skies slash across clouds and the dark silhouette of a dragon soars over the city. Beyond the towers, a massive wheel turns methodically and between the spokes I can make out semblances of castle, mansions, block-shaped buildings, spires, and towers, and all things mechanics and magic.

I gulp. The stories my teachers told always described Stelstrom as a beautiful home, made of cool stone and green vines and enchanting woods. This looks evil.

The dragon begins to curve downward, honing to some unknown beacon. I’m still not sure how dragon-carrying works, but I can’t really think about that right now.

Isaac lets out a whoop. “First dragon landing! Put your hands in the air, it’s more fun!”

I’m not exactly in the mood.

We fly over the walls. The dragon enters a cloud of steam. I can’t see anything but gray and water until the sky and sun slashes my vision suddenly and we are landing at a balcony-like protrusion from one of the massive towers. We enter what is like a stable with stalls and feed, but the stalls are ten feet high each and the feed is a massive pile of animal carcasses.

The dragon lets out a throaty roar.

“Steady there, Frellan!” A woman shouts. “Don’t be a useless whiner!”

I freeze. Useless whiner? There’s only one person I know who—

“What the hell? Warren?”

A young woman stares up at me, holding the dragon’s bridle. She wears a paperboy cap over dirty blonde hair, patched trousers, and a raggedy vest over a shirt that was probably white at some point.

Vinnie Smith.

[[Talk to Vinnie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Talk to Vinnie" tags="" position="407,800" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $letterPosition is &quot;Pocket&quot;&gt;&gt;\
She grins and strides forward. “Warren Lawson! Never thought I’d see you again!” She grabs my arm and jerks me to the ground. I stumble and stagger, trying to regain my balance.

“Vinnie,” I reply. I smile and try to straighten my uniform. “It has been awhile. How are you?”

She pulls a disgusted face. “Ew. So formal.” She turns and offers a hand to help Isaac down. 

“Who’s this?”

“Isaac Summers, miss,” Isaac replies, grinning. He takes her hand and dismounts the dragon. He gestures between us. “You two know each other?”

Vinnie laughs. “Do we! We used to do everything together! Our mothers were maids in the same manor.”

“And then you left,” I say. I try to make it sound joking, but it comes out a bit wrong.

Vinnie’s smile fades. She nods slightly. “Aye. And then I left.”

There’s an awkward silence. Isaac casts me a terrified look. He hates awkward silences.

“Well!” Vinnie claps her hands together. I jump. She grins widely and circles the dragon. She unlatches the case from the saddle and lifts the lid. “Got any food? I’m starved.”

I hurry towards her. “Don’t…!”

She pulls out my journal. She stares at it for a long moment, and her smile becomes a little less 
forced and a lot more… sad? Confused? Social navigation has never been my strong suit.

“You haven’t changed a bit, have you?” She says. “Still writing those little diaries.”

“Ha! See, it is a diary!” Isaac exclaims. He crosses his arms triumphantly. “I told him it was a diary.”

Vinnie glances at Isaac, then back to the dia—journal, dammit. She doesn’t open it. Just stares at it.

She opens it to the last page, tears out the blank piece of paper, grabs my pen from the case and scribbles something down on it.

“Look, I don’t know what you’re doing here, but meet me at this address tomorrow. We need to talk.” She presses the note into my hand, closes the journal, and replaces it in the case. She nods to Isaac. “Nice to meet you.”

With that, she grabs the dragon’s bridle and strides deeper into the tower. Over her shoulder, she shouts instructions. “Door’s behind you. Exit the tower and speak to the gentleman at the bottom of the stairs. He’ll get you where you need to be.”

As Vinnie disappears into the tower, Isaac moves to stand next to me, watching her go.

“What was that all about?” He asks.

“I don’t exactly know,” I reply.

“Huh,” He says. “I didn’t know your mom was a maid.”

“What’d you think she was, a fairy?” I grab the case and tuck it under my arm. I walk to the door. “Let’s go. We’ve got a ball to attend.”

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
She grins and strides forward. “Warren Lawson! Never thought I’d see you again!” She grabs my arm and jerks me to the ground. I stumble and stagger, trying to regain my balance.

“Vinnie,” I reply. I smile and try to straighten my uniform. “It has been awhile. How are you?”

She pulls a disgusted face. “Ew. So formal.” She turns and offers a hand to help Isaac down. 

“Who’s this?”

“Isaac Summers, miss,” Isaac replies, grinning. He takes her hand and dismounts the dragon. He gestures between us. “You two know each other?”

Vinnie laughs. “Do we! We used to do everything together! Our mothers were maids in the same manor.”

“And then you left,” I say. I try to make it sound joking, but it comes out a bit wrong.

Vinnie’s smile fades. She nods slightly. “Aye. And then I left.”

There’s an awkward silence. Isaac casts me a terrified look. He hates awkward silences.

“Well!” Vinnie claps her hands together. I jump. She grins widely and circles the dragon. She unlatches the case from the saddle and lifts the lid. “Got any food? I’m starved.”

I hurry towards her. “Don’t…!”

“Bloodworth,” She whispers. She holds the letter in hand, staring at the seal. Her hand shakes a bit. She looks up at me, wide-eyed. “You know Bloodworth?”

“No,” I reply. “He sent for me.”

“Are you in trouble?” She asks. She drops the letter back into the case, as if it were an ugly rat.

“I…” What can I possibly say to that? I don’t even know.

“Of course not!” Isaac says. “We’ve done nothing to get us in trouble! We’re fine, no need to worry.”

Vinnie still stares at me, concerned.

She suddenly strides forward, grabs my hand, and shakes it. “Good to see you again, Warren.” 

Something papery presses into my palm. Vinnie raises an eyebrow at me, then turns and nods to Isaac. “Good day, sir.”

Taking the dragon’s bridle, she turns and walks off deeper into the tower.

“What was that all about?” Isaac asks.

“I don’t know.”

“Huh,” Isaac says. “Strange girl.” He grabs the case and starts towards a door in the wall behind us.

When he’s far enough away, I glance at the paper she pressed in my hand.

[[Continue|Ball Entrance]]
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Ball Entrance" tags="" position="407,951" size="100,100">One of Bloodworth’s carriages, a sleekly elegant vehicle with spires decorating the top rim lead by two glossy black horses, awaits us at the foot of the tower. A pompous-looking servant ushers us inside and slams the door. The windows are curtained and I’m too nervous about getting food stains or oil stains or any kind of stains on them that I don’t move them to observe the view, even though, logically, I know my hands are clean. I’m nervous. I was nervous before, but running into Vinnie did not help. She reminds me of everything I ought to be nervous about.

After a short trip, we arrive at a fancy hotel where the pompous servant ushers us into the lobby and the lobbyist then ushers us into a room and the room service-woman ushers us into the dining area and sets finger sandwiches, mini cakes, and light punch before us. Isaac asked for something a bit more, but she said we would spoil our appetites for the ball.

“We can’t arrive on time,” Isaac says, licking his fingers after the fifth cake. “We’ve got to be probably an hour late. That’s what fancy people do.”

“We’re not fancy people,” I reply.

“We are right now! Look at this place!” Isaac gestures wildly around him. “We’re fancy.”

I try to smile at his antics, but honestly, I can’t. I’m far, far too nervous. I need to calm down before this ball. Being frightened won’t help anything. A walk might do me good.

“I’m going out. I’ll be back in time for the ball though.” I grab my coat and pull it on. “Ball starts at 9 and we will be getting there at 9.”

“It really should be ten,” Isaac grumbles.

“Nine,” I say decisively. I grab a sandwich, stuff it in my mouth, and then head for the door.

Stelstrom’s layout begins by making sense, a logical grid system separated into districts each having a different purpose such as markets, government buildings, or manors, but then, as wealth decreases and population increases, the grid system breaks down and then disappears. Coalcoast Lane, the street indicated on Vinnie’s mysterious letter, is a street lined with hawkers selling garbage food, beggars who are too tired to beg, and muck six inches deep with a ragtag bunch of children wading through it, searching for treasures washing down from the logical grid into their land of chaotic squalor. The sky is invisible, in part due to smog and in part to the precarious stack upon stack tenement buildings.

I cover my nose with my handkerchief and attempt to curb my disgust. Rivermire had its poorer areas, to be sure, but nothing to this extent.

People stare at me as I pass. I am by no means well-dressed, but I am clothed in clean clothes, and that is more than I can say for any of these people.

I stop and close my eyes, just trying to breathe. What am I doing here? I’m only in this godforsaken city because Bloodworth, the most powerful man in all of Knoll, ordered me to come to his mockery of an ancient holiday celebration. Attending a rebellion meeting is neither my prerogative nor is it intelligent in any way.

Yet I’m here.

[[I should go. I can always talk to Vinnie again at the dragon stables. She would understand that it would be foolish for me to attend.|Leave]]
[[I should wait for a few minutes, maybe wander the streets. Maybe I can find her.|Wait for Vinnie]]

I wander the streets, gaining more and more strange looks as I pass. Street urchins keep brushing next to me, obviously trying to pickpocket me. Fortunately, I had the foresight to come with empty pockets. The more looks I receive, the more I realize how completely conspicuous I am. 

With Bloodworth’s involvement in my life, that can’t be a good thing.

I spot an old woman huddled beneath makeshift hovel, a little space made from discarded wood and cloth. She gazes at the crowd with mild but intelligent eyes. If I’m going to talk to anyone, she seems like a good start.

“Excuse me, ma’am,” I say gently.

She raises an eyebrow at me. “Aye?”

“Do you know of a woman named Vinnie Smith?” I say. “She’s average height, blondish hair, wears boy’s clothes a lot.”

The old woman eyes my uniform. “I might. What do you want with her?”

“She told me to come here.”

The old woman smirks. “She did, did she? Down the street a few buildings and take a right.”

“Thank you,” I reply, though I’m not sure if my thanks is premature. She could just be trying to get rid of me. I don’t really blame her for the sentiment though. I press a coin into her hand and follow her instructions, walking past the next few tenement buildings and then taking a right down the first alley I discover.

Vinnie Smith stands there, tapping her foot. She grins widely when she sees me. “It’s about time!” She grabs my arm and pulls me into the alley. “Come on! We have to hurry!”

[[Stop and demands information]]
[[Go along with Vinnie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Stop and demands information" tags="" position="435,1401" size="100,100">Skid to a halt. “I’m not going with you until I get some answers. What is this?”
Vinnie pauses. She laughs softly to herself. “Sometimes, I forget what the years can do to a person.”

She walks over to an upturned crate and sits on it. She pats the space next to her and I take it, surprised. I’ve never seen her look so contemplative.

“Warren, do you remember when we were kids? When we played cops and robbers among the laundry our poor mothers kept trying to hang in the garden? You were always the cop and I was always the robber. That’s how we liked it.”

I shake my head, trying to stifle a smile. I did remember, though not exactly like that. “No, Vinnie. That’s how you liked it. You always wanted to be the robber so I had to be the cop.”

She grins. “So I manipulated the truth in my mind a bit. My version’s better. It seems more equal.”

I roll my eyes. “I know from experience there’s no point in arguing with your delusions. But what does this have to do with the fact that you and I are currently sitting in a disgusting alley because you gave me a cryptic note and I’m just stupid enough to go along with it?”

“You’re not stupid!” Vinnie says. She’s suddenly intense, staring directly into my eyes. She grabs my hand. “You’re not stupid. You’re good, Warren. I know you’re good.”

“We haven’t seen each other in years.”

“But I know!” Vinnie continues to stare. I look away, dropping my gaze to the ground. There’s a translucent white slug crawling through the dirt, looking eerily beautiful while simultaneously hideous. I watch its slow progress.

“Look at this place. Look at this ‘disgusting alley’, as you put it. Stelstrom was never like this. It was never supposed to be like this. Everything has been corrupted by greed and want and excess. 
I left Rivermire because I wanted to live life like my father, striving to be better than I had been born. Mother never cared much. She was too complacent. She was content to be a maid working for some nobody in some nobody city-state. Not Father. And not me.” Vinnie nudges the slug with her foot. It moves a bit faster. “I thought that perhaps change was possible within the regime. But I see now it is not. We must purge everything, rid ourselves of everyone within that disgusting government and start anew.”

“You’re not stupid either, Vinnie,” I say quietly. “Mass execution will only lead to anarchy and that will only lead to death.”

“Normally, I’d agree.” Vinnie nods. “But not after I met Mynatt.”

“Who is that?” I ask.

Vinnie stands and offers me her hand. “Come and see!”

[[Go along with Vinnie]]
[[An uneasy feeling grows in the pit of my stomach. This has the makings of a classic rebellion doomed to tragic failure. Angry, starving poor. An idolized leader. A lack of faith in the government.

We zigzag through the alley until we reach a building that looked even more decrepit than the surrounding decrepit buildings. Vinnie knocks on the door- three times, pause, soft twice, three more times- and the door swings opens. It’s pitch dark in there. Vinnie takes me hand again and pulls me inside.

“Stairs, careful” She says.

She leads me down stairs. The darkness gets darker.

She knocks again, the same pattern as before. Another door swings open and light floods my vision, causing me to slam my eyes shut against the sudden stinging.

Once my eyes adjust, I can see that we stand in a simple, small room. There are a few chairs set up in a circle but nobody else is here.

“Commander Mynatt,” Vinnie says, snapping to a salute.

“Ms. Smith,” A cool voice says. A door, hidden in the wall, opens on the far side of the room. A tall, willowy middle-aged woman, wearing a dress that strangely looks militaristic with it’s smart metal buttons, sturdy material, and gold cuff and collar designs, steps into the room.

She pauses at the sight of me. “And a guest. Apparently.”

“This is my friend, Warren Lawson,” Vinnie says. “He is visiting from Rivermire.”

Mynatt smirks. “Visiting. Hardly.”

She prowls forward and offers me her hand. I take it and we shake, but she squeezes hard, threateningly. “Mary Eleanor Mynatt.”

“Warren Lawson,” I reply.

“What are you really doing in Stelstrom, Warren Lawson?”

“Visiting,” I reply.
She chuckles darkly. “Ah, Stelstrom. The vacation spot of the world, known for its hospitality and healthy atmosphere. Don’t insult me, child, you are not visiting.”

“He’s being attacked by James Bloodworth,” Vinnie says.

“Bloodworth?” Mynatt eyes me with more interest. “Bloodworth is after you?”

“I don’t know,” I reply.

“Hmm…” Mynatt says. She leans closer, as if trying to get a better look into my soul. “I doubt you know much. But tell me this, do you believe all people are created equal?”

[[&quot;Absolutely, I want to help.&quot;|Aid Rebellion]]

“Excellent,” Mynatt says. She waves me away dismissively. “You can take him away for now, Vinnie. We’ll be in contact. Get him where he needs to be and then return quickly for the meeting.”

“He can’t stay for the meeting?” Vinnie sounds disappointed.

“No,” Mynatt says. “Not until he has proven himself trustworthy.” She waves again. “Run along.”

And with that, I am shooed out of Mynatt’s presence, out of the strange house, out of the alley, and out of Coalcoast Lane.

I return to the hotel, confused and overwhelmed, but determined to survive the ball without being bombarded with thoughts of my bizarre day.
